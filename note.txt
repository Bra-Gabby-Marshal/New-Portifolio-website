NProgress: is a JavaScript library that can be used to show a progress bar on a website. In Next.js, it can be used to indicate to the user that a page is loading or that an action, such as a form submission, is being processed. NProgress provides a sleek and customizable way to display a loading indicator, making the user experience smoother and more enjoyable. By using NProgress in Next.js, developers can add a subtle and elegant visual cue to indicate that something is happening in the background, improving the overall user experience of the application

npm i isomorphic-unfetch
"isomorphic-unfetch": is a library for making HTTP requests in both client-side and server-side JavaScript environments. The term "isomorphic" means that the same code can be used in both client and server environments, which can be useful in situations where code needs to be shared between the frontend and backend.
"isomorphic-unfetch" is a light-weight alternative to the popular "fetch" API, which is available in modern browsers but not in Node.js, the environment in which server-side JavaScript is executed. By using "isomorphic-unfetch", developers can make HTTP requests in a consistent manner across both client and server environments, making it a useful tool for implementing data fetching and APIs in isomorphic JavaScript applications, such as Next.js.
